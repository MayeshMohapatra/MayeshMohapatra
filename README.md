# Hi there, I'm Mayesh Mohapatra 👋

Master of Computer Science student at **Texas A&M University** focusing on the intersection of **3D Computer Vision**, **Deep Learning**, and **Biomechanical Analysis**. 

Current research at TAMU involves developing modular 3D reconstruction pipelines for dynamic sports analysis, specifically investigating the decoupling of camera ego-motion from global human trajectories.
